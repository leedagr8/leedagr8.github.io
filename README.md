A website about me

HTML - stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used as the building blocks for developing a webpage.
To break it down even further Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages are **linked together**, and a Markup Language means
to mark-up a text document with **TAGS**, that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
